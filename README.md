# RSA Encryption Talk

The code in this repo was used for a presentation I gave called How Prime
Numbers Keep the Internet Secure.

The `client.rb` and `server.rb` files include code for a very simple
client-server app where the client generates RSA encryption keys, passes the
public key to the server and the server responds with an encrypted message. The
client then decrypts the message and outputs it to the console.

I will also be writing a blog post on this subject, which I will link here when
it is finished.
